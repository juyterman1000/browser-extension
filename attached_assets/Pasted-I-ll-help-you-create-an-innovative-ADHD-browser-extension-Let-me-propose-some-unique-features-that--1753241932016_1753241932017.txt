I'll help you create an innovative ADHD browser extension! Let me propose some unique features that address real ADHD challenges in ways that haven't been done before:
"FlowState" - The ADHD Companion Extension
Core Innovative Features:

Hyperfocus Circuit Breaker

Detects when you've been on the same site/task for too long
Gently interrupts with a "body check" reminder (posture, water, bathroom)
Unlike blockers, it celebrates your focus while protecting your wellbeing


Task Momentum Keeper

When you switch tabs impulsively, it shows a quick "breadcrumb" of what you were doing
"You were 3 paragraphs into that article about [topic]" with a one-click return
Reduces the "what was I doing?" spiral


Dopamine Queue

Instead of blocking "fun" sites, it queues them as rewards
"Finish this paragraph and you've earned 5 mins of Reddit"
Gamifies boring tasks with immediate rewards


Context Restoration

Saves your entire browser state (all tabs, positions, even text in forms)
One-click "workspaces" for different projects/modes
Perfect for ADHD context-switching struggles


Impulse Buffer

When you try to open a new tab/bookmark impulsively, it asks: "New thought?"
Captures it in a "thought parking lot" without breaking your flow
Review parked thoughts later when you're ready



Let's start building! I'll create the foundation:FlowState Extension - manifest.jsonInteractive artifactÂ Designed clean, ADHD-friendly popup interface for browser extension.1sNow I'll create the main popup interface that users will interact with. This should be clean, ADHD-friendly (not overwhelming), and provide quick access to key features.Now let's create the main popup interface with ADHD-friendly design:FlowState Extension - popup.htmlInteractive artifactÂ Crafted popup.js to manage browser extension interactions.1sNow I'll create the popup.js file that handles the interactions in the popup interface. This will manage the toggles, thought parking, and communication with the background script.Now let's create the popup JavaScript to handle user interactions:FlowState Extension - popup.jsCodeÂ // popup.js - Handles all popup interactions

// Initialize popup when DOM is loaded
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
    // Load saved settings
    const settings = await chrome.storage.sync.get({

// Initialize extension state

    lastActivity: null
};

let features = {

I've built a comprehensive ADHD browser extension with truly innovative features that work with the ADHD brain instead of against it. Here's what we've created:
Core Innovation Features:

Hyperfocus Circuit Breaker - Celebrates deep focus while protecting physical wellbeing
Task Momentum Keeper - Shows what you were doing when you impulsively switch tabs
Dopamine Queue - Gamifies productivity by turning distractions into earned rewards
Thought Parking Lot - Captures random thoughts without breaking flow
Context Restoration - Save/restore entire browser workspaces

Files Created:

manifest.json - Extension configuration
popup.html/js - Main control interface with ADHD-friendly dark theme
background.js - Core service worker handling all features
content.js/css - In-page overlays for momentum keeper
blocked.html - Gamified task completion page
icon.svg - Visual representation of connected ADHD thoughts
README.md - Comprehensive documentation

Key Design Principles:

Non-punitive: Celebrates focus rather than punishing distraction
Gamified: Makes boring tasks rewarding with immediate dopamine hits
Context-aware: Helps maintain task context during switches
Body-aware: Reminds about physical needs during hyperfocus
Flexible: All features can be toggled based on current needs

To Use:

Create a new folder and save all the artifact files
Convert the SVG icon to PNG formats (16x16, 48x48, 128x128) and place in an icons/ folder
Load as an unpacked extension in Chrome developer mode
Start using immediately - default settings are ADHD-optimized

What Makes This Unique:
Unlike existing ADHD tools that just block or track, FlowState:

Acknowledges hyperfocus as a superpower that needs gentle boundaries
Captures impulses instead of fighting them
Rewards task completion with guilt-free fun time
Maintains context when your brain jumps around
Works with your ADHD patterns, not against them

This extension treats ADHD traits as features to work with, not bugs to fix. It's built on the understanding that ADHD brains are different, not broken, and need tools that embrace that difference.
Would you like me to add any additional features or modify any existing ones? Some ideas for expansion:

Integration with task management apps
Daily ADHD-friendly analytics
Medication reminders
Social accountability features
Voice note thought capture
